## 👨‍💻 Career

### The long story

I’m currently working as a Cybersecurity Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer at the global Cyber Defence Center of Siemens, where I focus on developing AI solutions to improve the security posture of Siemens. However, it took some time and lots of effort to become this awesome!! 💪💪 Up next, I will tell you the short version of how I arrived here.

My family comes from different parts of Spain, but I was brought up in the wonderfull city of Madrid. My first 18 years were mainly focused on enjoying life and soaking everything I could from school. Interestingly, I had never been naturally sharp at mathematics, but everything changed when I received the news that my worst grade by the end of the first trimester of the academic year of 2015 (1 year before entering on the baccaleurate) was that of mathematics: I had failed with a 4.9 in a scale of 10 points.

I wanted to get into the International Baccaleurate (IB) to get the best opportunities in the future, so I set the goal to turn around my mathematics records by the end of the year. I started overcompensating my current inaptitude with effort, and found myself studying all week days. This may seem unhealthy, but for sure effort brings passion. As a matter of fact, I soon started taking notes about chapters that were not in scope, and reading both mathematics and physics books. Watching movies like *A Beautifull Mind*, *Good Will Hunting* or *Gattaca*, and reading books like *Meditations on First Philosophy* by René Descartes certainly contributed to my eagerness to learn!

Long story short, by the end of the year my best grades were in Mathematics and Physics, and my overall average was above 9 out of 10. Consequently, I was given the oportunity to do both the National and Internation Baccaleurates in the branches with engineering subjects. I certainly took the chance. The next two years were really exhausting as I had to focus on a national baccaleurate with a focus in heavy hard work in many topics, while also keeping up with the rigorous International Baccaleurate focused in reflecting, interiorizing and deepening in concepts to then think outside the box. I feel that this combination really brought my best version!

By the end of 2018 I had graduated for both baccaleurates, received a Study Award and was granted a place in the Mathematics Degree of the University of Lancaster at the United Kingdom. A new journey was awaiting me!

My years in the United Kingdom really had an impact on me. Firstly, I discovered a world of very different people with different perspectives that I found fascinating. Actually, during my years there I shared flat with people from the United Kingdom, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bulgaria, Germany and Australia among others. I am particularly gratefull of this experience because it made me understand how people can be simultaneously so different and so similar, and I got the opportunity to learn so much about different cultures.

Regarding my academic undergoing, I started studying mathematics at a top tier university. As a summary my years in university can be defined by a challenging beginning as I was adjusting to my new international life with a great ending story of academic success. Incidentally, my overall classification for my MSCI degree in Mathematics was that of a First Classification (the highest tier that can be achieved), and my master's dissertation ended up being selected as the best mathematics dissertation from Lancaster and, consequently, I competed with it in the Celebration of the Best Maths Projects in the North West 2022 - [Institute of Mathematics & Its Applications](https://ima.org.uk/). By the end of the competition, my dissertation on *Brownian Motion and it's application to the Dirichlet Problem* ended up as the third best dissertation of UK's north west.

## 🚀Projects & Events

A showcase of things I’ve built, collaborated on, or am particularly proud of:

- **[Neo4j&Siemens Munich Graphaton - 2025]**  
  As a participant of the Neo4j&Siemens Graphaton, I was involved in a team working in using GraphML & Data Analysis to prioritize and solve cybersecurity related events appearing in a digital twin of Siemens infrastructure.

- **[Agents-MCP-Hackathon - 2025]**  
  During a week and a half, we developed two solutions aimed at helping Cybersecurity Analysts with ticket triage via Agentic AI:

  **1.** [First Delivery](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Agents-MCP-Hackathon/TDAgentTools): An MCP server providing tools used by the average Cybersecurity Analyst on their ticket triage workflow.

  **2.** [Second Delivery](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Agents-MCP-Hackathon/TDAgent): An AI Agent capable of enriching or handling cybersecurity-related tickets by leveraging tools from our MCP server.

## 🎨 Life Beyond Code

Because there’s more to life than mathematics, commits and pull requests:

- 🏃 **Sport Nerd Alert** 🏃:

  - I love running since young, but my freak life started in 2017 when I started running half marathons! Here is a photo of my last half marathon in Ibiza:
    <img src="images/project-thumbnail.jpg" width="500"/>
  - I am a certified Advanced Open-Water Diver by PADI.
  - In 2025 I started compiting in open-water swimming races. Guess what? It is here to stay!!
  - I love climbing indoors, going to the gym, playing tenis and padel.
 
- 📖 **Reading** 📖: I love reading classics, thrillers, history and even essays! Nowadays I am mostly focused on reading about ancient and contemporary history. Some of the books I recently enjoyed:

  - [SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome. Mary Beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPQR:_A_History_of_Ancient_Rome) - How did Rome changed from a Kingdom to a Republic? How did it involve into an Empire?
  - [Nuclear Folly: A History of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Serhii Plokhii](https://www.huri.harvard.edu/news/nuclear-folly-serhii-plokhiis-latest-book-examines-cuban-missile-crisis) - If you are interested about nuclear warfare and nonproliferation why don't you start by learning about the Cuban missile crisis.
Nevertheless, my favourite book is for sure *The Egyptian* by Mika Waltari.

- 🎶 **Music** 🎶: which are my most heard bands/artists:
  
    1. Muse  
    2. Nothing but Thieves  
    3. Billie Eilish  

- ✈️ **Travel** ✈️: I know - who doesn't?
  
- 🎬 **Favorite Movie** 🎬: *Gattaca*
  
- 🎧 **Podcasts** 🎧: I enjoy listening to:  
  [**The LexfridmanP Podcast**](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) - AI, USA politics, world peace & entretainment  
  [**Mas de Uno**](https://www.ondacero.es/programas/mas-de-uno/) - spanish politics & other news
 
- 🌍 **Languages** 🌍: I am bilingual in both english and spanish, and have a B2 in French!
