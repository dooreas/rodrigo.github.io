## 🎨 Life Beyond Code

Because there’s more to life than mathematics, commits and pull requests:

- 🏃 **Sport Nerd Alert** 🏃:

  - I love running since young, but my freak life started in 2017 when I started running half marathons! Here is a photo of my last half marathon in Ibiza:

  - I am a certified Advanced Open-Water Diver by PADI.
  - In 2025 I started compiting in open-water swimming races. Guess what? It is here to stay!!
  - I love climbing indoors, going to the gym, playing tenis and padel.
 
- 📖 **Reading** 📖: I love reading classics, thrillers, history and even essays! Nowadays I am mostly focused on reading about ancient and contemporary history. Some of the books I recently enjoyed:

  - [SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome. Mary Beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPQR:_A_History_of_Ancient_Rome) - How did Rome changed from a Kingdom to a Republic? How did it involve into an Empire?
  - [Nuclear Folly: A History of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Serhii Plokhii](https://www.huri.harvard.edu/news/nuclear-folly-serhii-plokhiis-latest-book-examines-cuban-missile-crisis) - If you are interested about nuclear warfare and nonproliferation why don't you start by learning about the Cuban missile crisis.
Nevertheless, my favourite book is for sure *The Egyptian* by Mika Waltari.

- 🎶 **Music** 🎶: which are my most heard bands/artists:
  
    1. Muse  
    2. Nothing but Thieves  
    3. Billie Eilish  

- ✈️ **Travel** ✈️: I know - who doesn't?
  
- 🎬 **Favorite Movie** 🎬: *Gattaca*
  
- 🎧 **Podcasts** 🎧: I enjoy listening to:  
  [**The LexfridmanP Podcast**](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) - AI, USA politics, world peace & entretainment  
  [**Mas de Uno**](https://www.ondacero.es/programas/mas-de-uno/) - spanish politics & other news
 
- 🌍 **Languages** 🌍: I am bilingual in both english and spanish, and have a B2 in French!
